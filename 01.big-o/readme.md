# big-o

#### _`time complexity`_:

> How can we analyze the **_`runtime`_** of an algorithm as the size of the inputs increases?

#### _`space complexity`_:

> How much additional **_`memory`_** do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm?
>
> - most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are **_`constant space`_**
> - strings require **_`O(n)`_** space (where _n_ is the string length)
> - reference types are generally **_`O(n)`_**, where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)

> **_performance.now()_** -> the function that returns milliseconds since the program was created.
